# WWDC19 SUBMISSION [ACCEPTED]

# About App:
    The app is made by Raghav Vashisht for WWDC19 Scholarship, The app is a proof of concept making use of Hapticfeedback and audio alerts which makes it possible to read Braille Script on a flatscreen device.
 
    The idea is that, the user would slide over the screen and when he encounters a reaised circle (represented by a dark circle in app) the app would send back a haptic and an audio alert, thus making is possible for the blind user to read the braille script.
 
    The app also integrates an English-to-Braille converter whose sole purpose was to keep the app dynamic and avoid using hard coded Braille script.
